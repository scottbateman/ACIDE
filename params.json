{"name":"ACIDE","tagline":"Academic, Collaborative, Web-based IDE","body":"# ACIDE - Academic, Collaborative IDE\r\n\r\nACIDE is a web-based IDE that was forked from the **[Codiad](http://codiad.com/)** framework, which has a small footprint and minimal requirements. The system is still early in development, and while it has been proven extremely stable please be sure to backup regularly if you use it in any production work.\r\n\r\nKeep up to date with the latest changes through the **[Github repo page](https://github.com/scottbateman/ACIDE).\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nInstallation of ACIDE requires uploading the files and making several directories and a config file writeable. Unike the Codiad there is a Mongo database required for logging interactions. PHP 5.3 or above is recommended, however, the system will work with any version of PHP over v.5.\r\n\r\nFor more information please **[read the installation instructions]()**, some additional information may be available on the **[Codiad Wiki](https://github.com/Codiad/Codiad/wiki)**.\r\n\r\n## Interface and Functionality\r\n\r\nACIDE consists of three panels; a left panel which houses the file manager and active files, center panel which is where editors reside, and a right panel which contains system and other controls. The right side panel collapses and there's no top toolbar to provide maximum real-estate to the editor. \r\n\r\nACIDE provides user management, course administration, and the ability for students to work on and submit  individual or group assignments.\r\n\r\n![ACIDE Screenshot](http://codiad.com/screenshot.jpg)\r\n","google":"UA-34692757-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
